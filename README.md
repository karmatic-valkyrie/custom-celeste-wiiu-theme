# custom-celeste-wiiu-theme
A custom Celeste theme I made for the Nintendo Wii U!

To use this theme, you will need to use [RomPatcherJS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js) to patch *your* own copies of the system files. 
I also highly recommend utilizing the [Aroma](https://aroma.foryour.cafe) environment and the StyleMii Aroma plugin for convenience's sake, but you can also use SDCafiine and the Tiramisu environment to load this theme as well. I have only tested this on a US region Wii U and I don't know how well it will work on other region consoles. The AllMessage.szs is very unlikely to work on any other region, but in theory the other files should work. 
If you would like to make your own custom Wii U theme or look at other custom themes that people have made, then I would recommend joining the [Theme Caf√©](https://discord.gg/R3Z5xpnGJ7) discord server. You can also just follow [this](https://gatokun.github.io/ThemeCafe/themecreation/themes/template) guide for creating your own theme.

Here's a preview for the theme:

(The crunchy audio is from the less than optimal capture card I used, the actual audio sounds great.)
