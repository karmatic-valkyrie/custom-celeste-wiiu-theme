# custom-celeste-wiiu-theme

To use this theme, you will need to use [RomPatcherJS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js) to patch *your* copies of the relevent system files dumped from your Wii U. 
I also highly recommend utilizing the [Aroma](https://aroma.foryour.cafe) environment and the StyleMii Aroma plugin for convenience's sake, but you should be able to also use SDCafiine and the Tiramisu environment to load this theme as well. I have only tested this on a US region Wii U and I don't know how well it will work on other region consoles. The AllMessage.bps is very unlikely to work on any other region, but in theory the other files should just work. 
If you would like to make your own custom Wii U theme or look at other custom themes that people have made, then I would recommend joining the [Theme Caf√©](https://discord.gg/R3Z5xpnGJ7) discord server. You can also just follow [this](https://gatokun.github.io/ThemeCafe/themecreation/themes/template) guide for creating your own theme.

Here's a preview for the theme:

(The crunchy audio is from the less than optimal capture card I used, the actual audio sounds fine. I used the highest quality version of the background music that I could, as well as the minimum amount of compression required to stop the Wii U from crashing without sacrificing Mii and other Home Menu sounds. The compression may be more noticeable on higher quality speakers though unfortunately.)
