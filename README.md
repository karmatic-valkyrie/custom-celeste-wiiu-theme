To use this theme, you will need to use [RomPatcherJS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js) to patch *your* copies of the relevant system files dumped from your Wii U. 
I also highly recommend utilizing the [Aroma Environment](https://aroma.foryour.cafe) and the StyleMii Aroma plugin for convenience's sake, but you should be able to also use SDCafiine and the Tiramisu environment to load this theme as well. The AllMessage.bps is probably going to cause issues for Wii Us from other regions (EUR, JPN, etc.), so I wouldn't use that particular patch if you don't have a US Wii U. Also, I've done all of the testing on my own US Wii U and although I've been told it works on EUR Wii Us (and as a result it probably works on the other ones too), I can't guarantee that it will work on all other region Wii Us. Also DO NOT place the patched files into the MLC or SLC, I am NOT responsible for any potential damage or bricks you might cause to your Wii U by directly modifying the internal files or by "cold booting" this theme. Instead place them onto the SD Card in the relevant directories, then if you have any issues (i.e. crashes, infinite loading, etc.) you can simply remove the modified files from your SD Card and tell me that it isn't working.

Here's a preview for the theme:

(The crunchy audio in the preview is from the less than optimal capture card I used, the actual audio sounds fine. I used the highest quality version of the background music that I could, as well as the minimum amount of compression required to avoid causing the Wii U to crash without sacrificing Mii sounds, but the compression may be more noticeable on higher quality speakers and headphones though unfortunately.)

If you would like to make your own custom Wii U theme or look at other custom themes that people have made, then I would recommend joining the [Theme Caf√©](https://discord.gg/R3Z5xpnGJ7) discord server. You can also just follow [this guide](https://gatokun.github.io/ThemeCafe/themecreation/themes/template) for creating your own theme.
