# custom-celeste-wiiu-theme

To use this theme, you will need to use [RomPatcherJS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js) to patch *your* copies of the relevant system files dumped from your Wii U. 
I also highly recommend utilizing the [Aroma Environment](https://aroma.foryour.cafe) and the StyleMii Aroma plugin for convenience's sake, but you should be able to also use SDCafiine and the Tiramisu environment to load this theme as well. The AllMessage.bps is probably going to cause issues for Wii Us from other regions (EUR, JPN, etc.), so I wouldn't use that if you don't have a US Wii U. The other patches should be ok though. Also, I've done most of the testing on my own US Wii U and although I've been told it works on EUR Wii Us (and as a result it probably works on the other ones too, you should be careful and take backups of your original unmodified files. DO NOT place the patched files into the MLC or SLC, I am NOT responsible for any potential damage or bricks you might cause by directly modifying the internal files or by coldbooting this theme. Instead place them onto the SD Card in the relevant directories.

Here's a preview for the theme:

(The crunchy audio is from the less than optimal capture card I used, the actual audio sounds fine. I used the highest quality version of the background music that I could, as well as the minimum amount of compression required to stop the Wii U from crashing without sacrificing Mii and other Home Menu sounds. The compression may be more noticeable on higher quality speakers though unfortunately.)

If you would like to make your own custom Wii U theme or look at other custom themes that people have made, then I would recommend joining the [Theme Caf√©](https://discord.gg/R3Z5xpnGJ7) discord server. You can also just follow [this guide](https://gatokun.github.io/ThemeCafe/themecreation/themes/template) for creating your own theme.
