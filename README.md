# custom-celeste-wiiu-theme
A custom Celeste theme I made for the Nintendo Wii U!
To use this theme you will need to use RomPatcherJS to patch *your* own system files. I also highly recommend utilizing the Aroma environment and the StyleMii Aroma plugin for convenience's sake, but you can also use SDCafiine to load this theme as well. I have only tested this on a US Wii U and I don't know how well it will work on other region consoles. The AllMessage.szs is very unlikely to work on any other region, but in theory the other files should work.
